A Soundboard made with python!!!
Might need to install Tkinter, Pygame, Sounddevice, Numpy for python and OBS studio (Audio Output Capture) if you want other people to hear your soundboard (Alternatives might work).
This was made in windows and not tested in Linux or macOS!!!
Special thanks to ChatGPT and Copilot.

ONLY WORKS WITH .MP3 FILES!!!
