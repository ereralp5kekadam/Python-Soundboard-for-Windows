A Soundboard made with python!!!

Need to install Tkinter and Pygame for python and [VB Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) and OBS Studio if you want other people to hear your soundboard (Alternatives might work).

This was made in windows and not tested in Linux or macOS!!!

Special thanks to ChatGPT and Copilot.
